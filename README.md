# AFK Chieftan Simulacrum Farmer

This script is buggy, poorly written and prone to getting stuck... but it works!
The goal is to farm simulacrums using AFK Chieftan. I cobbled this together with some very old code I had written, some AI generated garbage and two brain cells. 
I generally see it get stuck after a few hours but it's great to have running while I'm focusing on other stuff.
